Materials to build a self contained nix store in an environment with NFS filesystem where you don't have root access and user namespaces are not switched on.

The main downside of this approach (compared to the proot approach) is that you won't be able to utilize exising nix caches, since they assume that the store is located at /nix/store. Everything will be recompiled from scratch.

Instructions:

1. Set prefix in hpc-nix.nix to the full path of target home directory.
2. run ./build.sh

A few more gotchas:

- You will need to set the environment variable NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE on the target otherwise nix won't be able to fetch things via https
